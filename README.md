This resposiroty was used as a code managment system for my team's senior design project.
the project was to design and implement a landing base that would secure and carry a quadcopter.
the system was designed to have maximum autonomy between a drone and landing base.
the drone was programmed using DRONEKIT-PYTHON and OPENCV to land on top of the base autonomously using visual guidance and GPS.
the drone is also programmed to launch from the landing base.

The codes in this repository include tests,finals, and copied source code. Many sources from the internet were used in our final designs and tests.
I do not own any rights to any potentially copied codes in this repositry and we used this repository as a storage for source code and tests.

Libraries/API/Software used:
OPENCV
DRONEKIT
